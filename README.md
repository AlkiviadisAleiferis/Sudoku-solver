# Sudoku-solver
A Python sudoku solving application i developed 
with Tkinter GUI and Google OR-tools.
I formed the linear programming model and implemented it with
Google OR-tools constrained programming solver cp-sat.
If you gave up solving then you came to the right place.

Download the following libraries to use: google ortools, tkinter.
Executing the sudoku_GUI.py file will do the job!
